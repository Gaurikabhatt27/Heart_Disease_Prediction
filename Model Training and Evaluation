4. Splitting the Data into Training data & Test Data

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y, random_state=2)
print("\n\n",X.shape, X_train.shape, X_test.shape)


5. Model Training

# -> Logistic Regression

model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# training the LogisticRegression model with Training data
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)


6. Model Evaluation

# -> Accuracy Score

# accuracy on Training Data
X_train_prediction = model.predict(X_train)
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction, Y_train)

print("\n\n",'Accuracy on Training data : ', training_data_accuracy)

# accuracy on Test Data
X_test_prediction = model.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction, Y_test)

print("\n\n",'Accuracy on Test data : ', test_data_accuracy)
