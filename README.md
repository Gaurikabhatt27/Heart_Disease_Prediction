# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using ML techniques. The dataset includes key medical attributes. After preprocessing and EDA, a Logistic Regression model was trained to classify heart disease risk. The model provides probability-based predictions to assist in early risk detection and decision-making.
